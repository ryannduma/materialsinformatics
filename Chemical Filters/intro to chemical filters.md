# Introduction to Chemical Filters

Chemical filters are essential tools in materials informatics that help us narrow down the vast chemical space of possible materials to those that are likely to be stable and synthesizable. This section will introduce you to:

1. Basic principles of chemical filtering
2. Implementation of filters in SMACT
3. Common filtering criteria:
   - Charge neutrality
   - Electronegativity ordering
   - Oxidation state compatibility
   - Size factors
   - Electronic configuration

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will be able to:

- Understand the importance of chemical filtering in materials discovery
- Apply basic chemical rules to screen material compositions
- Use SMACT's chemical filtering capabilities
- Evaluate the effectiveness of different filtering criteria
