# About This Course

Welcome to the Materials Informatics Advanced Practical course! This repository contains a comprehensive set of tutorials and exercises designed to teach materials informatics using SMACT (Semiconducting Materials by Analogy and Chemical Theory).

## Course Overview

This course covers:

- Combinatorial explosion in materials discovery
- Chemical filtering techniques
- Compositional and stoichiometry screening
- Structure prediction and generation
- Advanced computational methods including:
  - Machine Learning Force Fields (MACE)
  - Density Functional Theory (DFT)
  - VASP computational framework
