# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the "Materials Informatics Advanced Practical" course! This course is designed to help you explore the exciting intersection of materials science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. You will learn how to leverage computational tools to accelerate the discovery of new materials, focusing primarily on the SMACT (Semiconducting Materials from Analogy and Chemical Theory) toolkit. SMACT offers a collection of rapid screening and informatics tools utilizing chemical element data to facilitate materials exploration.

Beyond SMACT, this course provides comprehensive coverage of advanced computational methods including Machine Learning Force Fields (MACE) and Density Functional Theory (DFT), giving you a complete toolkit for modern materials research. Whether you're screening millions of compositions, generating crystal structures with AI, or running quantum mechanical simulations, this course has you covered.

This website is intended to be an _interactive_ one-stop-shop where you can access all of the educational materials we'll be using in the course.

## Navigating the curriculum

The navigation panel on the left side provides quick access to different sections of this notebook.
Each chapter begins with an overview page containing a comprehensive list of pages and activities within that section. You can view this list by clicking the expandable down arrow (âŒ„).
To move sequentially through the content, use the navigation arrows located at the bottom of each page. However, feel free to jump around as you see fit!

### Note on external links

By default, all links in this textbook will open in your current browser tab. To open links in a new tab instead, you can either:
Hold `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on Mac) while clicking the link
Right-click the link and select {guilabel}`Open link in new tab`

This helps avoid having to repeatedly use your browser's back button to return to where you were in the textbook.
