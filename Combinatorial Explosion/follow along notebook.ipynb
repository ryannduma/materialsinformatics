    "First, let's understand the raw scale of possible combinations - This section of the notebook aims to demonstrate the sheer scale of the combinatorial explosion. Based on some assumtions about how many elements (103) or species - elements in oxidation states - (403) there are, it calculates how many binary, ternary, quaternary... combinations there can be, within different integers stoichiometry limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "this section contains **ZERO** chemistry. rather it is a mathematical exercise to demonstrate the claims above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers that are produced match roughly to the raw combinations (before chemical filters) numbers obtained in Table 1 of the publication [Computational Screening of All Stoichiometric Inorganic Materials](https://www.cell.com/chem/fulltext/S2451-9294(16)30155-3) (D. W. Davies et. al, Chem, 2016).\n",
    "Small deviations from the numbers are due to changes in what we class as an \"accessible\" oxidation state for some elements. **- to do reference this in the jupyter-books**\n",
