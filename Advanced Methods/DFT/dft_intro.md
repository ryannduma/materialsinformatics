## Available Resources

### Comprehensive Documentation

We provide detailed resources to help you understand DFT and its practical applications:

- **[DFT Theory](dft_theory.md)**: Comprehensive guide to the theoretical foundations of density functional theory
- **[VASP Overview](vasp_overview.md)**: Understanding VASP capabilities and how it compares with machine learning methods like MACE

These resources will give you a solid foundation in ab initio calculations and help you understand when to use DFT versus machine learning approaches.
