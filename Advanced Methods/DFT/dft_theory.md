# Density Functional Theory: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a fundamental tool in computational materials science and quantum chemistry. It provides a practical method for calculating the electronic structure of atoms, molecules, and solids with a reasonable balance between accuracy and computational cost. This guide explores the theoretical foundations, practical applications, and limitations of DFT.

## The Many-Body Problem

The primary challenge in quantum mechanics is solving the Schrödinger equation for systems with multiple electrons:

$$\hat{H}\Psi = E\Psi$$

For a system of N electrons and M nuclei, the Hamiltonian contains:
- Kinetic energy of electrons
- Kinetic energy of nuclei
- Electron-electron repulsion
- Nucleus-nucleus repulsion
- Electron-nucleus attraction

The exact solution scales exponentially with system size, making it intractable for all but the smallest systems.

## The Hohenberg-Kohn Theorems

DFT is built on two fundamental theorems proved by Hohenberg and Kohn in 1964:

### Theorem 1: Existence
The ground-state electron density $n(\mathbf{r})$ uniquely determines the external potential $v(\mathbf{r})$ (up to a constant).

**Implication**: All ground-state properties are functionals of the electron density.

### Theorem 2: Variational Principle
The ground-state energy can be obtained by minimising the energy functional:

$$E[n] = F[n] + \int n(\mathbf{r})v(\mathbf{r})d\mathbf{r}$$

where $F[n]$ is a universal functional containing kinetic and electron-electron interaction energies.

## The Kohn-Sham Approach

Kohn and Sham (1965) made DFT practical by mapping the interacting system onto a fictitious non-interacting system with the same ground-state density.

### The Kohn-Sham Equations

$$\left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + v_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf{r})\right]\phi_i(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon_i\phi_i(\mathbf{r})$$

where the effective potential is:

$$v_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf{r}) = v(\mathbf{r}) + \int \frac{n(\mathbf{r'})}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'}|}d\mathbf{r'} + v_{\text{xc}}[n](\mathbf{r})$$

The density is constructed from the occupied orbitals:

$$n(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{i}^{\text{occ}} |\phi_i(\mathbf{r})|^2$$

### Self-Consistent Field Procedure

1. **Initial Guess**: Start with trial density $n^{(0)}(\mathbf{r})$
2. **Construct Potential**: Calculate $v_{\text{eff}}[n^{(k)}]$
3. **Solve KS Equations**: Find orbitals $\{\phi_i\}$
4. **Update Density**: $n^{(k+1)}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_i |\phi_i(\mathbf{r})|^2$
5. **Check Convergence**: If not converged, return to step 2

## Exchange-Correlation Functionals

The exchange-correlation functional $E_{\text{xc}}[n]$ contains all the many-body effects. Its exact form is unknown, necessitating approximations.

### Local Density Approximation (LDA)

This approximation assumes the exchange-correlation energy density depends only on the local density:

$$E_{\text{xc}}^{\text{LDA}}[n] = \int n(\mathbf{r})\epsilon_{\text{xc}}(n(\mathbf{r}))d\mathbf{r}$$

where $\epsilon_{\text{xc}}(n)$ is the exchange-correlation energy per particle of a uniform electron gas.

**Advantages**:
- Simple and computationally efficient
- Works well for many systems

**Limitations**:
- Overbinds molecules and solids
- Underestimates band gaps
- Poor for systems with rapidly varying density

### Generalised Gradient Approximation (GGA)

Includes dependence on the density gradient:

$$E_{\text{xc}}^{\text{GGA}}[n] = \int f(n(\mathbf{r}), |\nabla n(\mathbf{r})|)d\mathbf{r}$$

Popular GGA functionals:
- **PBE** (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof): Widely used for solids
- **PW91** (Perdew-Wang 91): Earlier standard
- **BLYP**: Popular in chemistry

**Improvements over LDA**:
- Better molecular binding energies
- Improved barrier heights
- More accurate for inhomogeneous systems

### Meta-GGA Functionals

Include second derivatives of the density or kinetic energy density:

$$E_{\text{xc}}^{\text{meta-GGA}}[n] = \int f(n, |\nabla n|, \nabla^2 n, \tau)d\mathbf{r}$$

where $\tau = \sum_i |\nabla\phi_i|^2$ is the kinetic energy density.

Examples:
- **TPSS**: Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria
- **SCAN**: Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed

### Hybrid Functionals

These functionals mix exact Hartree-Fock exchange with DFT exchange:

$$E_{\text{xc}}^{\text{hybrid}} = \alpha E_{\text{x}}^{\text{HF}} + (1-\alpha)E_{\text{x}}^{\text{DFT}} + E_{\text{c}}^{\text{DFT}}$$

Popular hybrid functionals:
- **B3LYP**: 20% HF exchange, popular in chemistry
- **PBE0**: 25% HF exchange
- **HSE06**: Range-separated hybrid for solids

**Advantages**:
- Better band gaps
- Improved reaction barriers
- More accurate for charge transfer

**Disadvantages**:
- Computationally expensive
- Parameter fitting required

## Practical Considerations

### Basis Sets

1. **Plane Waves**: Natural for periodic systems
   - Systematic improvement with cutoff energy
   - Efficient with FFT
   - Requires pseudopotentials

2. **Gaussian Functions**: Common in molecular calculations
   - Localised basis
   - Efficient for molecules
   - Basis set superposition error

3. **Augmented Plane Waves**: Hybrid approach
   - All-electron method
   - Accurate but complex

### Pseudopotentials

These replace core electrons with an effective potential:
- **Norm-Conserving**: Accurate but harder
- **Ultrasoft**: Softer, more efficient
- **PAW** (Projector Augmented Wave): All-electron accuracy

### k-Point Sampling

For periodic systems, Brillouin zone integration is approximated by sampling:
- **Monkhorst-Pack**: Regular grid
- **Gamma-Centred**: For certain symmetries
- Convergence testing essential

## Limitations of DFT

### 1. Band Gap Problem
Standard functionals typically underestimate band gaps by 30-50% due to:
- Self-interaction error
- Derivative discontinuity
- Lack of many-body effects

### 2. Van der Waals Interactions
Standard functionals do not capture long-range dispersion interactions:
- Requires corrections (DFT-D, vdW-DF)
- Important for molecular crystals, layered materials

### 3. Strongly Correlated Systems
Fails for systems with localised d/f electrons:
- Transition metal oxides
- Rare earth compounds
- Requires DFT+U or beyond

### 4. Excited States
Ground-state theory, limited for:
- Optical properties
- Photochemistry
- Requires TD-DFT or many-body methods

## Advanced Topics

### DFT+U
Adds on-site Coulomb repulsion for localised electrons:

$$E = E_{\text{DFT}} + \frac{U}{2}\sum_{i,\sigma} n_{i\sigma}(1-n_{i\sigma})$$

### Time-Dependent DFT (TD-DFT)
Extension to excited states and dynamics:

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\phi_i(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat{H}_{\text{KS}}[n(t)]\phi_i(\mathbf{r},t)$$

### Constrained DFT
Fix certain properties (magnetisation, charge) to study specific states.
