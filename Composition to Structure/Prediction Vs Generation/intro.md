# Prediction vs Generation in Crystal Structure Discovery

This section explores the two main approaches to discovering new crystal structures: prediction-based methods and generative methods. We'll compare their strengths, limitations, and use cases.

## Overview

Crystal structure discovery methods can be broadly categorized into:

1. **Prediction Methods**:
   - Based on physical principles and chemical rules
   - Often use known structures as templates
   - Examples: Ionic substitution, data mining

2. **Generative Methods**:
   - Use machine learning to create new structures
   - Learn patterns from existing data
   - Examples: CHEMELEON, crystal GANs

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamental differences between prediction and generation
- Identify when to use each approach
- Combine methods for more robust structure discovery
- Evaluate the reliability of different methods
