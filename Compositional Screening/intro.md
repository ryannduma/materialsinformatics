# Compositional Screening: Mapping Chemical Space

Now that you understand chemical filters and their ability to eliminate impossible combinations, it's time to take a systematic approach to exploring specific regions of chemical space. **Compositional screening** is the process of comprehensively mapping all possible compositions within a defined chemical system.

## From Filters to Systematic Exploration

In the previous sections, we learned:
- How combinatorial explosion creates vast possibilities
- How chemical filters eliminate the impossible
- How to apply individual filters step by step

Compositional screening builds on these foundations to tackle a fundamental question: **"Within a specific chemical system, what compositions are possible, and which ones actually exist?"**

## What is Compositional Screening?

Compositional screening involves:
1. **Defining a chemical system** (e.g., Cu-Ti-O for oxide semiconductors)
2. **Generating all possible compositions** within that system
3. **Applying comprehensive chemical filters** to identify viable candidates
4. **Comparing with known materials** from databases like the Materials Project
5. **Visualizing the results** to understand the accessible compositional space

## Why This Matters for Materials Discovery

Consider searching for new solar cell materials in the Cu-Ti-O system:
- **Raw possibilities**: Thousands of compositions
- **After chemical filtering**: Hundreds of viable candidates
- **Known from experiments**: Dozens of actual compounds
- **Gap analysis**: Which filtered compositions haven't been made yet?

This gap represents **unexplored opportunities** for new materials discovery and design approaches.

## What You'll Learn

In this section, we'll explore:
- How to systematically generate compositional spaces
- Advanced filtering using multiple oxidation state sets
- Comparing theoretical predictions with experimental reality
- Creating ternary phase diagrams to visualize chemical space
- Using oxidation state probability analysis to refine predictions
- Identifying the most promising unexplored compositions

## The Cu-Ti-O Case Study

We'll use the Cu-Ti-O system as our example because it demonstrates:
- **Industrial relevance**: Important for photocatalysis and solar cells
- **Chemical complexity**: Multiple oxidation states and phases
- **Data availability**: Well-studied with known Materials Project entries
- **Visual appeal**: Perfect for ternary phase diagram visualization

## Building on Previous Knowledge

This section builds directly on our previous work:
- **Combinatorial Explosion** taught us the scale of chemical space
- **Chemical Filters** showed us how to eliminate impossibilities
- **Compositional Screening** now shows us how to map what remains

## Tools You'll Master

By the end of this section, you'll be comfortable with:
- SMACT's oxidation state filtering capabilities
- Materials Project API integration for validation
- Ternary plot visualization of chemical spaces
- Oxidation state probability analysis
- Systematic comparison of theory vs. experiment
